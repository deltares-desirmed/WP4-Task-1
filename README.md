# DesirMED: Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Resilience in the Mediterranean

Welcome to the **DesirMED GitHub Repository**, dedicated to advancing Work Packages (WP) 4.1 and 4.2 under the Horizon Europe Project **DesirMED (101112972)**. This project focuses on demonstrating and mainstreaming nature-based solutions (NbS) to enhance climate resilience across Mediterranean regions. Here, we provide tools, data, and methodologies supporting the identification, analysis, and application of transformative adaptation strategies.

## Project Scope

Climate change poses severe threats to ecosystems, economies, and social systems worldwide, particularly in the **Mediterranean region**, identified as a climate change hotspot. DesirMED aims to:

- **Preserve and restore ecosystems** using NbS.
- Enhance **climate resilience** through innovative governance, inclusive practices, and advanced technologies.
- Build knowledge and capacities for **regional leaders** to implement transformative climate adaptation strategies.

### Focus of This Repository
This repository supports **Work Package 4 (System Knowledge, Data & Design)**, particularly:

1. **Task 4.1**: Identifying Key Landscape Features
   - Characterizing Mediterranean landscapes in terms of climate resilience, resources, and ecosystem services.
   - Mapping landscape interconnections to understand shared resources and services.

2. **Task 4.2**: Developing Regional Risk Profiles
   - Synthesizing climate-related risks across Demonstrating and Replicating Regions.
   - Creating risk profile metrics that integrate climate and socioeconomic scenarios.
