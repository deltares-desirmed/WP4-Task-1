## Project Scope

**DesirMED** is a Horizon Europe-funded initiative focused on addressing the unique challenges posed by climate change in the Mediterranean region. This repository highlights the work from **Work Packages (WP) 4.1 and 4.2**, which aim to:

- Identify critical landscape features essential for climate resilience.
- Develop risk profiles integrating environmental, climatic, and socioeconomic data.
- Provide nature-based solutions (NbS) for adaptive governance and ecosystem preservation.

### Key Objectives
- **Preserve and restore ecosystems** by leveraging NbS.
- **Build climate resilience** using innovative analytical tools.
- **Support decision-making** through risk modeling and stakeholder engagement.
