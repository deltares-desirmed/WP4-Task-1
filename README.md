Welcome to the **DesirMED GitHub Repository**, a dedicated space to showcase ongoing work for Work Packages (WP) 4.1 and 4.2. This project is part of the Horizon Europe Project **DesirMED (101112972)** and focuses on integrating nature-based solutions (NbS) for fostering climate resilience across the Mediterranean region.

## Project Scope

Climate change presents critical challenges globally, with the Mediterranean identified as a high-risk region. DesirMED addresses these issues by:

- Restoring degraded ecosystems with NbS.
- Innovating adaptive governance systems.
- Empowering local stakeholders with tools and knowledge to implement climate adaptation strategies.

This repository specifically supports:

- **WP 4.1**: Identifying key landscape features critical to climate resilience.
- **WP 4.2**: Developing comprehensive risk profiles for targeted Mediterranean regions.

---

## Repository Overview

This repository serves as a central hub for:

- **Codebase**: Scripts and algorithms for analyzing Mediterranean landscapes.
- **Geospatial Data**: Preprocessed datasets ready for modeling and visualization.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualization tools for landscape and climate risk profiling.

### Quick Access to Articles and Outputs
- **[Key Publications](#)**: Direct links to articles related to WP4.
- **[D4.1 Report](#)**: "Guidelines for landscape characterization."
- **[D4.2 Report](#)**: "Regional climate risk profiles."
