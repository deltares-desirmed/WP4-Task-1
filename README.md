## Project Scope

**DesirMED** is part of the Horizon Europe-funded project dedicated to enhancing climate resilience in the Mediterranean region. This repository focuses on implementing and showcasing the outputs of **Work Packages (WP) 4.1 and 4.2**, which aim to:

- **Preserve and restore ecosystems** using nature-based solutions (NbS).
- **Enhance climate resilience** by applying advanced analytical tools and governance systems.
- **Empower stakeholders** with open-source geospatial tools to design and evaluate climate adaptation strategies.

### Key Objectives
- Identifying and characterizing Mediterranean landscapes critical for climate adaptation.
- Developing comprehensive regional risk profiles using geospatial data and models.
- Synthesizing results to inform decision-makers and local communities.
